# Description
The moment you have been waiting for: the final project. Create whatever you want to build; I hope by now you can see that you can do anything in Python! You are allowed to work with a partner and the project must be roughly be of a similar scale to one of the homework assignments. We encourage you to build something you can show off! Feel free to discuss project ideas with the instructor or TAs at office hours.

Two first-party packages: time and Faker
Two third-party packages: Django, numpy (both django and numpy are already available frameworks), and emoji
In-line documentation (i.e. comments in code)
README.md (installation instructions, code structure)
